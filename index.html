    <p>Irish singer, songwriter, and pop star Shane Filan enjoyed massive success throughout the 2000s as a member of the chart-topping boy band Westlife before launching a successful career as a solo artist in the following decade. During Westlife's 14-year tenure, the band managed to amass no fewer than 14 U.K. number one hits before marking their dissolution with a summer 2012 show in Dublin in front of 80,000 fans. Multi-platinum albums like Coast to Coast (2000) and World of Our Own (2001) cemented the group's place in U.K. chart history, and while Filan's subsequent solo career hasn't risen to quite such towering heights, he has remained a strong chart presence and developed his own voice as a songwriter, especially on his 2013 debut, You & Me.<br/>
    Born in Sligo, Ireland during the last summer of the '70s, Filan went on to develop his singing voice as part of various school productions, as well as in performances at the local Hawk's Well Theatre. Before his 20th birthday he had already achieved his first number one single with Westlife, when they issued their Steve Mac-produced debut, "Swear It Again." From 1999's Westlife to 2010's Gravity, all but two of their ten studio albums reached the top of the Irish albums chart, and following the October 2012 announcement of the band's plan to part ways, Filan was strongly rumored to be talking to various labels about a solo deal. He spent much of 2012 and early 2013 writing new material, and in April 2013 it was revealed that Filan had signed with London Records.<br/>
    His first solo single, "Everything to Me," nodded to the mainstream folk of the Lumineers and Mumford & Sons, and, like every other track on the full-length You & Me, it was co-written by Filan. Recorded in Dublin, London, and Nashville, You & Me kept the singer in the Irish and U.K. Top Ten and set the table for his 2015 follow-up, Right Here, which saw him switching to Warner Bros. imprint East West Records. That same year Filan also published the autobiography My Side of Life. For his third solo outing, he took a thematic approach, offering an album of some of his favorite love songs along with a handful of originals. Released in 2017, with a deluxe version arriving a year later, Love Always saw Filan reinterpreting songs by Bob Dylan, Crowded House, the Bangles, and *NSYNC.</p>

         <p>Former co-leader of internationally successful Irish boy band Westlife, Mark Feehily embarked on a solo career three years after the group split in 2012. Born Markus Feehily on May 28, 1980 and brought up in the seaport of Sligo in northwest Ireland, he grew up singing in the church choir and, while still in his teens, formed the boy band IOYOU with his friends Shane Filan and Kian Egan. The band came to the attention of impresario Louis Walsh, manager of Boyzone, who was looking to add another act to his stable. Walsh signed the band, tweaked the lineup, and Westlife was born. The band debuted in 1998 and was an immediate success. For almost 15 years, they topped charts around the globe, touring internationally and selling over 55 million records. In 2005, Feehily came out as gay in a newspaper interview after years of stress created by being in the closet had caused him to go into therapy; despite his fears, the response from the group's predominantly female fan base was largely positive. The split of Westlife in 2012 coincided with his breakup from his fiancé, and he went through a period of depression, which he channeled into his dark 2015 solo debut Fire, released under his birth name. A move home to Sligo from London to be closer to his family coincided with a new relationship, leading to a happier period in his life. In 2017, he shortened his name to Mark for the release of his sophomore album, Christmas, which he promoted by supporting Mariah Carey on her U.K. winter tour.</p>

        Born in Sligo, Ireland in 1980, singer Kian Egan found fame in the boy band Westlife in the late '90s alongside bandmates Mark Feehily, Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, and Brian McFadden. As part of the original line-up put together by choreographer Mary McDonagh and performing as Six as One and later as IOYOU (the band included Feehily and Filan along with three Sligo boys, Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett). It was only when Filan's mother approached Boyzone's then manager, Louis Walsh, that Egan's musical career progressed. Taking counsel from Simon Cowell, Walsh fired the three Sligo boys but kept Egan, Feehily, and Filan, and after auditions in Dublin, members Byrne and McFadden were recruited. This newly formed group began life named Westside in 1998, but due to another act using the name, it was changed to Westlife. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the band with Walsh, and they released their debut EP Swear It Again. The boys enjoyed phenomenal success right up to the latter stages of the 2000s. The departure of McFadden in 2004 did little to hinder their progress. Several multi-platinum albums and tours ensured the group were granted legendary boy band status, and allowed Egan to explore other options outside of the band during a hiatus in 2008. He joined forces with Walsh to co-manage a new girl band called Wonderland. The girls' debut album reached number six in the Irish album charts and the eighth spot in the U.K., but they were dropped by their record label, Mercury, just four months later. Egan began to explore television options from 2012 after the disbandment of Westlife, and appeared as a presenter on various TV shows such as This Morning's Hub and This Morning. He also co-hosted the revamped British TV show Surprise, Surprise in 2012 but did not return for the second series. He was invited to be one of the coaches on The Voice of Ireland alongside Sharon Corr, Bressie, and Brian Kennedy. Egan gained national popularity by appearing on and winning the British version of I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! in late 2013. In early 2014, it was announced that he had signed a deal with Rhino Records and would be releasing his debut album, Home, later in the year. The album's title track was a cover of the Daughtry song, and was released as a single in spring 2014.

         alt="Nicky Byrne"></div>
            <p>Irish singer/songwriter Nicky Byrne is best known for his time in successful boy band Westlife. Byrne was originally a semi-professional football player before he attended a live audition to join the group. The band, formerly known as IOYOU, had just fired three of their members based on advice from Simon Cowell. Re-branding themselves as Westlife, they held auditions for two new members, where Byrne, alongside Brian McFadden, joined Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, and Shane Filan to create the final lineup.

            Westlife enjoyed 14 years of chart success in countries worldwide; the only exception being the U.S., where they only achieved one hit single, 2000's "Swear It Again." In 2004, McFadden left the group to spend time with his family. Eight years later, in 2012, the rest of the band parted ways for good. In the years that followed, Byrne took on a number of presenting roles, both for radio and television, including an appearance on a popular U.K. reality show Strictly Come Dancing. In 2016, he made a move back toward his music career by writing and recording his debut album, Sunlight -- making him the last member of Westlife to release a solo record. Sunlight was released to coincide with his inclusion in 2016's Eurovision Song Contest, where he performed lead single "Sunlight" on behalf of Ireland.</p>
